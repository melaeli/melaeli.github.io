## Introduction

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Typeface-thesis.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="25" width="15%" align="right"/> This webpage is for a person who is (desperately) trying to finish her Master's Degree and especially - to write a thesis.
Ellu is studying language technology at the Helsinki University and proud of it. 
But as the time passes, so the skills are somewhat forgotten if not used enough...that's one of the challenge. And many more so please **check this site out**!

The site also includes some tips for all of you in the same situation, good luck! :)
